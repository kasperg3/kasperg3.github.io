    <b>Abstract:</b> Large-scale multi-robot systems have numerous potential real-world applications. It is, however, still unclear how a human operator can effectively engage and control a system composed of multiple autonomous robots, especially in unstructured and outdoor environments. This paper reports on ongoing work in the project HERD --- Human-AI Collaboration: Engaging and Controlling Swarms of Robots and Drones, in which we focus on two concrete use cases from industrial partners, namely farming and search \& rescue. One of the industrial partners, Agro Intelligence ApS, currently sells autonomous farming robots, while the other, Robotto ApS, develops autonomous drone-based monitoring solutions for emergency responders. Both partners aim to scale their technologies to multi-robot/multi-drone operations. In this paper, we present the two use cases, their differences and similarities, challenges and preliminary results.

    <b>Abstract:</b> Multi-UAV systems have significant potential to enhance search and rescue~(SAR) operations, since a search area can be covered faster than current approaches when multiple UAVs operate in parallel. While recent advancements within the field of multi-robot coverage planning have yielded promising results, current algorithms are predominately centralized. In this paper, we present a generalization of the well-known decentralized consensus-based bundle algorithm~(CBBA), that enables efficient task allocation in multi-UAV SAR operations. The generalized algorithm considers tasks as trajectories between two points where the traversal direction for each task is optimized in the task allocation process. We carry out a series of simulation-based experiments on benchmark problems and compare our results to a state-of-the-art centralized solution. We find that our novel decentralized approach yields times to completion similar to those achieved with a centralized coverage path planning approach, with only $1.9\%$ overhead cost. We furthermore find that our approach performs $6\%$ better than point allocations while scaling well with the number of UAVs involved in the search effort.

    <b>Abstract:</b> Emergency services organizations are committed to the challenging task of saving people in distress and minimizing harm across a wide range of events, including accidents, natural disasters, and search and rescue. The teams responsible for these operations use advanced equipment to support their missions. Given the risks and the time pressure of these missions, however, adopting new technologies requires careful testing and preparation. Drones have become a valuable technology in recent years for emergency services teams employed to locate people across vast and difficult to traverse terrains. These unmanned aerial vehicles are faster and cheaper to deploy than traditional crewed aircraft. While an individual drone can be helpful to personnel by quickly offering a bird's eye view, future scenarios may allow multiple drones working together as a swarm to reduce the time required to locate a person. Given these potentially high payoffs, we explored the challenges and opportunities of drone swarms in search and rescue operations. We conducted interviews as well as initial user studies with relevant stakeholders  to understand the challenges and opportunities for drone swarms in the context of search and rescue. Through this, we gained insights to inform the development of prototypes for drone swarm control interfaces, including both technical and human interaction concerns. While drone swarms can likely benefit search and rescue operations, the significant shift from single drones to swarms may necessitate re-imagining how rescue missions are conducted. We distill our findings into five key research challenges: visualization, situational awareness, technical issues, team culture, and public perception. We discuss initial steps to investigate these further.
